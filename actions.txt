github action: CI/CD platform that allows to automate sdlc tasks
               It is beyond this.

workflow: configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs
          triggers when a particular event happens
          defined by yaml file
          e.g. PR, labelling, testing and building pipeline, merging requests, etc.
          series of actions that needs to be done
          inside  ".github/workflows" as a .yml file
          needs atleast one job

job: set of steps that execute on same runner(machine)
step: script/action, executed in order, can transfer data among different steps

* action: custom application, used with 'uses: actions/<name>@'
          e.g. actions/upload-artifact@v2, actions/download-artifact@v2, etc.

* each job runs on different machines in parallel unless dependent

* environment variables: to store some info to be used later, scopes work like C language dynamic scoping
                         default env variables: env(prints all default env variables for different runners), $GITHUB_ENV, etc.

* settings/secrets/actions: everything stored here are encrypted, we can't see it but always update it
                            we use it in github actions in yml file as `${{secrets.<name>}}` but just prints "***", but we can use it for any other purpose

* github artifacts: share/stores data once workflow has ended
